## Usage

To run the Android instrumentation tests make sure to set `RUN_PERFORMANCE_TESTS` in [`Common\build.gradle`][1] to `true`.

To run with Android Studio, create a new `Android Instrumented Tests` run configuration. Specify the desired `PerfTest<x>` class and a test method (see [`BasePerfTestCase`][2]).
